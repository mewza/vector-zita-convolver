SIMD Vectorized Zita Convolver v1.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And here it is! As promised... This is SIMD optimzized (vectorized) templated C++ version of 
the latest Zita Convolver. It utilizes AVFFT SIMD vector optimized FFT for best performance, 
there may be bugs still use at your own risk, or fix them and send me fixes.. but it works and 
it doesn't crash. What else... IT is FASTer than PFFFT'd ZitaConvolver.

That's it for now.

Only Use technology for benefit of humanity never to enslave it!
